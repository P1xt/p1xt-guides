# Learn enough HTML

The prototypical HTML skeleton begins with an html tag containing two elements, a head and a body. These latter tags are nested inside the html tag, as follows:
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>

We mentioned above that it’s possible to link directly to images on the Web, a practice called hotlinking. The way to do this is to use a fully qualified URL as the src parameter, like this:

<img src="https://example.com/images/example.jpg" alt="A nonexistent example">
Hotlinking isn’t usually a good practice, mainly because the image has to be at that exact spot on that exact site or it will not load, putting you at the mercy of the site’s maintainer. The person who runs the site can also be charged for the bandwidth used to serve the image, so hotlinking is considered inconsiderate as well. For these reasons, we generally recommend using local images for most applications
