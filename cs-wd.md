**Note:** @kevcomedia has ported the entire list into a Trello board you can clone to keep track of your progress you can find the Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/4v9dpn3G/cs-wd).

**Note:** Scroll to the bottom and read the "Things to Keep in Mind" section. It contains information about how to approach the list that is just as important as the list itself.

**Note:** This Guide is heavier on computer science than the other, if you want less of the heavier computer science and more on practical web development you might want to check out [Guide: Web Development with Computer Science Foundations - comprehensive path ](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-guide-web-development-with-computer-science-foundations-comprehensive-path/64516) as well and pick the one that most meets your goals.

## Prerequisite

The **only things** that you need to know are how to use **Git** and **GitHub**. Here are some resources to learn about them:

**Note**: Just pick one of the courses below to learn the basics. You will learn a lot more once you get started!

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
- [Git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
- [GitHub Training & Guides](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-)
- [GitHub Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/index.html)
- [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

**There WILL be math. And, it's important. If the thought frightens you, or bores you, or has you thinking "this isn't for me", head to [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) right now, sign up, and start devoting 30 minutes a day. This is an investment that will pay off. I'm not making this up.**

## Bookmarks you should have
* [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) - deploy your frontend projects here (or use github pages)
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - look HTML, CSS, and JavaScript stuff up here
* [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) - deploy your fullstack projects here (or hyperdev)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) or [mLab](https://mlab.com/) - database hosting
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - store your code here
* [Material Design](https://material.google.com) - lean on this when you need a structure for creating a minimalistic but awesome looking site
* [Material Palette](https://www.materialpalette.com/) - for selecting color schemes
* [Wirify](https://www.wirify.com/) - for quickly turning a web page into a wireframe so you can see the big picture instead of all the graphics

## Things to keep in mind

* have git commits every week, most of the days of the week
* try to get in one of @tropicalchancer's cohorts - be active once you're in
* try to pick one to two other languages to use regularly for solving algorithms and implementing projects in addition to JavaScript (good choices would be to pick one of C++, Java or Python and one of Golang or Rust).

#### For each item you should:

* take notes, on a blog, in markdown, wherever, somewhere - not about what you read, or about what the instructor said - about what you learned
* build something - even if it's just a 20 line function that computes something you find interesting
* if you build something, document it and test it as appropriate
* do the exercises, build the projects - fully, not some scaled down halfassery

#### For four projects of your choosing

* Seek 1-3 other developers to collaborate on the project
* Coordinate with the team to complete the project
* Build the project out to a full production quality application
* Invite others who are not associated with the team to rigorously test the final product.
* Resolve any legitimate issues found

#### Once per month - do two or more of the following:

* Write up a comprehensive blog post or markdown entry in a repository detailing the high points of what you learned that month
* Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NIb9l3imAo) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eg5-tdAwclo) - on interviewing
* Read [this](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.co.uk/2007_09_01_archive.html) - on crafting a resume
* Do one lesson from [CUST104: Business Communications](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=345)
* Live stream what you're working on for an hour. Or, lend a hand to someone who needs help by screensharing and walking them through it.
* Catch up on industry reading on sites like [Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/), [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/), [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/articles), [UX Myths](http://uxmyths.com/), [JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)

#### If you need a breather from an item, do one of these, then get back to it

* complete a project from FCC that isn't included in this list
* pick a pet web development project you can code in a week and complete it
* code another android application
* write a guide for the FCC wiki or create a video tutorial and post it to YouTube
* learn golang or rust and complete any of the backend projects from FCC with that language as the backend language
* redo any of the algorithmic type projects you've already completed from the list, in a language other than JavaScript
* pick an open source project from [Code Triage](https://www.codetriage.com/) and contribute to fixing an open issue
* visit the FCC forum and pick a couple of the toughest questions, that people are having trouble getting help with, and help them
* code a flash cards application, for jotting quick notes you can use to quiz yourself later

#### Revisions

#### Attribution

* Many of the courses listed closely mimic the list from [Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)
* Many of the topics selected to augment were inspired by [Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university)
* Many of the projects were inspired by (or are directly taken from) [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) and [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/)



**Note:** Don't ask me how long this will take you. I do not know your aptitude, determination, or propensity for flitting off to check Facebook every 5 minutes, nor do I know how much time you have available to devote daily. Begin working through it and gauge for yourself the speed with which you progress. I promise you, if you just start from the top and work your way down, you won't accidentally learn something useless while you figure out your learning pace.

**Note**: I took some care to ensure that this list contains only resources which are legitimately free.  You may need to give Heroku a credit card if you host all your projects there. If you don't want to /can't do that, just deploy locally, deploy to heroku, and then delete the app from heroku once you've moved on to a different project (that won't work for FCC certification because it needs to be accessible to meet the guidelines, but for the purposes of this list, once you're done with a project, I don't see a lot of value in persisting it on the web while you're working on something else --- UNTIL, you need to polish your portfolio for a job application, then you would want to have your best projects running online).

Although I took heavy inspiration from many resources when creating this guide, none of it is a cut and paste path from somewhere else. Often, I substituted courses (especially in the case of Coursera) to ensure that the entire course was available for free and required no purchases of any kind. Where possible, I tried to align projects to reinforce prior learning.
