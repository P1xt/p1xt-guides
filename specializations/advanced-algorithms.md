# Computer Science - Advanced Algorithms Specialization

Pick this specialization to focus on higher level mathematics and algorithms and gain practice with data structures and algorithms of the type one might find in coding competitions or in whiteboard interviews.

**Note:** This is a more advanced specialization. [Computer Science - Algorithms](./algorithms.md) should be considered a pre-requisite.

**Note:** This specialization is more involved and will require more effort than some of the other specializations.
