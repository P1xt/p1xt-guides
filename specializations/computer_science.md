# Computer Science - Intensive Specialization

This specialization dives deep into computer science from algorithms and data structures all the way through databases, compilers, operating systems, and other advanced topics. It is best attempted as the capstone to tier 4 as it reinforces the breadth of knowledge built in that tier.

**Note:** Though this list may seem far shorter than other specializations, this specialization is actually far more work. There is a LOT of study involved.

| If you did not pass the exam with at least 80% correct, repeat the study process and then take the 2017 test as an open book exam. Then, retake the 2019 exam closed book.                                                                                                                                                           |            |

| Create a website highlighting what you learned and built during this specialization. Use this as an opportunity to create a portfolio of your projects, notes, blog posts, etc.                                                                                                                                                      |            |              |
