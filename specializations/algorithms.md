# Computer Science - Algorithms Specialization

Pick this specialization to gain a ton of practice with data structures and algorithms of the type one might find in coding competitions or in whiteboard interviews. Note: this has value outside interviews, it will help you learn to solve complex problems efficiently which is a valuable skill throughout your programming career.

**Note:** This is a more advanced specialization which will rely on knowledge introduced in tier 2 and reinforced in tier 3, so it would be best to wait until one of those tiers to tackle it.

**Note:** If you elect to select this specialization in multiple tiers, select a different language per tier to get the experience of how solutions are implemented in various languages.
