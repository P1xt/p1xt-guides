# Game Development Specialization

Pick your targeted platform, programming language, and related framework and complete the following:  
**Note:** Choices include, but are not limited to

- JavaScript/TypeScript using the Phaser framework targeting Android, iOS, and/or Web
- C# using Unity targeting Android, iOS, and/or Web
- C++ using Unreal Engine targeting Android, iOS, and/or Web

**Note:** Each Tier Programming Project in this tier should be a game you create - it can be a clone or a new idea, but the deliverable for each project is a completed game. Do not deploy non-original (clone) games to app stores - you'll get sued - you've been warned.

You may elect to complete this specialization more than once by selecting it as your capstone for multiple tiers.
