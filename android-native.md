# Native Android Programming - comprehensive

This guide makes heavy use of "official docs" for Java and Android, plus projects and cources from the Udacity
Android Nanodegree programs, augmented with a Tier of "Computer Science" to ensure that your ability to 
craft expert level Android applications won't be hampered by lackluster math or
algorithm training.

**Note:** For many assignments and projects in this guide, you are
tasked with creating a "sample" type application, or with cloning an application which already exists.
Use good judgement when you get to the point that you are actually deploying apps to the app store. Only
publish apps which are your original creations, using your original content and assets. Don't get sued 
publishing something you copied or cloned.

## Advanced Project ideas

* clone any game from the game programming guide (or any other game you enjoy) as a native Android application
* create a real time chat application (clone your favorite instant messenger) - note you'll need to build a backend in 
order to make this work. Use any backend you like, suggestion: check out firebase.
* create an educational app, useful for learning and practicing subject matter you're highly familiar with (like android programming)
* create an app for a non-profit in your area, whatever they need
* contribute to open source, on any android or java project
* make any android app you want from your original idea, deploy it to the app store
