# Changed to the curriculum
Typically this will only list resource additions and deletions. The goal is always to minimize changes to the curriculum, so that someone following it isn't trying to 'hit a moving target'. However, from time to time, a resource becomes no longer available, and the curriculum will be modified to accommodate a replacement resource.
