## Project Overview
You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library. 

## Why this Project?

Stock Hawk gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems and practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love.  

Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. 
Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over. 

## What Will I Learn?

In this project, you will: 

* Diagnose existing issues with an app. 
* Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.
* Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries. 
* Handle error cases in Android. 
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage the functionality of a library in your app.

## How Will I Complete this Project?

You will improve the Stock Hawk app for this project. 

You can download the starting code for Stock Hawk in the Downloadables section. The app currently finds stock prices from the internet and allows users to add stocks to track. 

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UX Review and implement changes that will make the app production ready.

All of the issues you **need** to address to meet specifications are hinted at in the UX Review. There are also a few optional ways in which the apps can be improved that are not mentioned in the UX Review.

### Supporting Courses
You should have the skills you need to complete this app after completing <a href="http://www.udacity.com/course/ud853-nd" target="_blank">Developing Android Apps</a> and
  <a href="http://www.udacity.com/course/ud855-nd" target="_blank">Advanced Android App Development</a>.

### Required Tasks

* Download a zip file of the app code from the Downloadables section.
* Read the UX Review in the next node.
* Spend time exploring the current state of the app, looking for ways they could be improved. Be sure to look specifically at issues called out in the UX Review. 
* Execute the improvements! 
* For Nanodegree students: Make a single GitHub repo with your code for both apps, and submit through the Nanodegree portal. See the Submission and Evaluation node for detailed instructions. 

For detailed information on how your project will be assessed, see the Rubric node.



## Project Rubric

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to <a href="https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/4302058591/rubric" target="_blank">this rubric</a>. 

Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass. 

Continue to the next node for submission and evaluation instructions.

## Submission and Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to the rubric in the previous node. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

**Note**:  Please make sure you **clean** your project before creating a zip file or pushing code to a Github repository. You can clean your project by following the instructions given in **[this](https://goo.gl/E7aBxo)** link.

If you are using Github to host your projects, please make sure the code you want to submit for review is in the **master** branch of your repository.

**IMPORTANT: If you're submitting via a public Github repository, please make sure any external API key that you utilize, has been removed from your code.**  It's highly unsafe (and often breaks the Terms of Service) to include API keys in public repos, so you need to remove yours. You can add a note in a README file where a reviewer should go to insert their API key. Reviewers have been trained to expect this situation.

When you're ready to submit your project, click on Udacity in the navigation bar at the top your screen to return to your Udacity Home. Then, locate and expand the project you'd like to submit. Click on the button to submit your project. You can view the submission process in more detail <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sfMGTlUxxkcZM6iRXbVZ45vPPZGRD4qEp3ENBGSmZ_o/pub?embedded=true" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you have any problems submitting your project, please email us at **android-project@udacity.com**. Due to the high volume of submissions, the turnaround for your project can take **up to a week**.

Each Android ND project will be reviewed against the<a href="http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html" target="_blank"> Common Project Requirements</a>, in addition to its project-specific rubric.
