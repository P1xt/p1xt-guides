# Project 5: Force Golf

## Project Description

### Project Overview

For this project, you will make a top-down [minigolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_golf) game with a space-aged aesthetic. A typical minigolf game consists of 18 holes, you may think of them as levels, that constitute an entire course. For each level in the course, a player is tasked with hitting a ball into a hole â€” this is the core gameplay mechanic for Force Golf.

Players will be able to control the direction and force applied to a ball as it is hit around a level. Each time the ball is hit, a stroke is recorded. The goal is to complete a level, or an entire course, in the smallest number of strokes possible.

You will build a LibGDX project, create a data representation of a level, implement a simple level loader, and then use Box2D to execute the physics required for a single level of Force Golf. It should be noted that levels typically contain hazards intended to obstruct a clear path from the ball's starting position to the hole. This makes gameplay more fun and challenging, and you are encouraged to include such hazards in the level you build.

### Why This Project?

Force Golf is at its core a physics game, and it lends itself very well to being implemented with Box2D. By completing this project, you will not only gain experience working physics in 2D, but you will also be well-prepared to work with other physics engines. Additionally, we wanted to give you a project that allows for experimentation and creativity. Since you have the freedom to build levels as you see fit, you have an open canvas for designing interesting gameplay that utilizes all Box2D has to offer.

### What Will I Learn?

You will learn how to utilize Box2D to simulate 2D physics in a game. Through this project, you will be introduced to concepts like forces, collision detection, and joints. Even if you do not have a formal physics background, you will still be able to gain a working knowledge of how physics are defined and applied in games. This will give you the ability to build your own 2D physics games and give you a great starting point if you decide to work with 3D physics.
