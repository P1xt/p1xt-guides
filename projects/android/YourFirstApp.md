Beginning Android Project 1: Your First App

##Project Overview
Design and implement a single screen app that displays information about a small business that you are closely familiar with.

Here are some app ideas to help brainstorm:

- Details about a small business in your neighborhood
- Contact info and description about your workplace or school
- Info about a special interest group (like a club or sports team) you’re part of and how new members can sign up

Your design should include:
- at least one photo representing the business
- Name
- Description
- Phone Number
- Address
- Website (optional)
- Hours of Operation (optional)

Note: Be sure to check with the business for permission to use their name and details before you share your work publicly.


##Why this project?
This project is a way for students to demonstrate the concepts they learned in the Developing Android Apps course by building out the design.

##What will students learn?
Students will learn how to:
* Use View Groups, Image Views, Text Views, and Button Views to display a screen on an Android application

##How Grading Works

We have created a document that gives rubric specific instructions to help grade Developing Android Apps projects. You can access the document here:

It is VERY IMPORTANT that you read this document before you begin evaluating projects.
