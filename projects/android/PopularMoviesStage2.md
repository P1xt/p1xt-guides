## Project Overview
Welcome back to Popular Movies! In this second and final stage, you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.

You’ll add more information to your movie details view:

* You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
* You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
* You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
* You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.

Lastly, you’ll optimize your app experience for tablet.

Recall from Stage 1, you built a UI that presented the user with a grid of movie posters, allowed users to change sort order, and presented a screen with additional information on the movie selected by the user:

In Stage 2, you will go one step further and allow the user to view movie trailers, read reviews, and select favorites.

Lastly, you will take the entire end-to end-user interaction flow, including what you built in Stage 1, and optimize it to work on tablets.

## What Will I Learn After Stage 2?
* You will build a fully featured application that looks and feels natural on the latest Android operating system (Lollipop, as of May 2015).
* You will optimize the UI experience for both phones and tablets.

## How Will I Complete this Project?

### Supporting Course Materials
You should have the skills you need to complete this project after completing the Developing Android Apps course, focusing on Lessons 4 and 5.

You are expected to have passed the Popular Movies, Stage 1 project prior to beginning this project.

### Implementation Guide
Just like in Stage 1, we've come up with a set of milestones that will help structure your development and ensure that you reach the final product smoothly. These milestones are listed in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlN1fUsCSKuInLECcJkslIqvpKlP7jWL2TP9m6UiA6I/pub?embedded=true#h.7sxo8jefdfll" target="_blank">Stage 2 Implementation Guide</a>.

## Project Rubric
Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to <a href="https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/4324689102/rubric" target="_blank">this rubric</a>.

Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

## Submission and Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to the rubric in the previous node. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

**Note**:  Please make sure you **clean** your project before creating a zip file or pushing code to a GitHub repository. You can clean your project by following the instructions given in **[this](https://goo.gl/8lgeV5)** link.

If you are using GitHub to host your projects, please make sure the code you want to submit for review is in the **master** branch of your repository.

**IMPORTANT: If you're submitting via a public Github repository, please make sure any external API key that you utilize, has been removed from your code.**  It's highly unsafe (and often breaks the Terms of Service) to include API keys in public repos, so you need to remove yours. You can add a note in a README file where a reviewer should go to insert their API key. Reviewers have been trained to expect this situation.

When you're ready to submit your project, click on Udacity in the navigation bar at the top your screen to return to your Udacity Home. Then, locate and expand the project you'd like to submit. Click on the button to submit your project. You can view the submission process in more detail <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sfMGTlUxxkcZM6iRXbVZ45vPPZGRD4qEp3ENBGSmZ_o/pub?embedded=true" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you have any problems submitting your project, please email us at **android-project@udacity.com**. Due to the high volume of submissions, the turnaround for your project can take **up to a week**.

Each Android ND project will be reviewed against the<a href="http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html" target="_blank"> Common Project Requirements</a>, in addition to its project-specific rubric.
