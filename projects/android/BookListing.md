# Project Overview 
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making a book listing app using an API query and a ListView.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. You will be using the google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user.

If you are subscribed to the paid Nanodegree program, coaches will be available in the Coaches Lounge to help guide you through the final project. You will receive feedback after submitting your project and a verified certificate after successfully finishing this project.

If you are enrolled in the free version of this course, the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/164/view) and all of the project details are available to you.

Either way, we would love to see a description and link to your app on the discussion forum.
# Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned about the web and about how to get data from an api. You also learned how to parse that data and display it to a user. This project gives you the ability to practice those skills, which will be key in developing any app which makes use of a backend server, real time data, or interactions over the internet.
 
# What Will I Learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:
* Fetching data from an API
* Using an AsyncTask
* Parsing a JSON response
* Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user.
