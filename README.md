## Tier 1 - Web Development Foundation

### Goal
The goal of Tier 1 is to gain a robust foundational knowledge of web development and become confident at coding beginner to intermediate-level web projects. It should provide a stepping stone for branching into other facets of development or for diving deeper into more advanced web development.

### Instructions:
- Proceed through the projects alongside the Odin Project so that you are always practicing by building a project on Frontend Mentor while you progress through Odin.
- When you begin working on the Frontend Mentor projects, sign up for their discord and engage with the community. Help others when you can.
- Include mathematics in your studies if possible. There is a General Mathematics Progression at the bottom of the [Notes](#notes) below to guide you to whatever course in the sequence is appropriate for your level.
- Leverage the reading material listed for this tier while completing the projects. It covers the materials from the courses in much greater depth and will help a lot. You should be familiar with both reading it and using it as a reference when you have questions by the end of the tier.
- Near the end of this tier, polish up two of your best projects, showcasing your best work, for potential leverage in creating your portfolio in Tier 4.

## Tier 3 - Interview Prep

### Goal
The goal of Tier 3 is to gain skills that will serve you well as you begin a job search. This tier dives deep into data structures and algorithms which will not only help in interviews but will also teach you to create efficient code that will work well on the job. The programming language used for this tier is Java and that choice is intentional as familiarity with a more structured language will inform how you program in whichever language you might be using in the future. 

### Instructions:
- Proceed through the courses in order
- Always be practicing. Ideas for practice:
  - Challenges on [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/training) in Java. Note that, for the first time, CodinGame also shows up in the activities below. You should aim to have finished 100 challenges on CodinGame from a mix of difficulty levels before completing this tier.
  - Math progression on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math). This is the tier where you'll really notice it if you haven't been building up your math skill - often, understanding an algorithm is more about understanding how it works logically (mathematically) than knowing how to program it.
  - [Ask ChatGPT to assign you a programming challenge](./RequestingChallengesFromAI.md) 
- Take time to read from the reading list
- Near the end of this tier, polish up two of your best projects, showcasing your best work, for potential leverage in creating your portfolio in Tier 4.

## Tier 4 - Develop a Portfolio

### Goal
The goal of Tier 4 is to polish a portfolio of your best work.

### Instructions:
- Create an online portfolio of your best work. You can:
  - Polish projects you've completed previously
  - Complete new projects
- Ensure the portfolio is visible online
- Ensure that you've adhered to good coding practices
- Ensure that your projects are clean and free from errors
- Aim for between 5 and 10 projects and ensure at least two projects are substantial in size and scope
- If you intend to dive deeper into React or Angular in Tier 5, you may choose to include a few less projects at this point, knowing that you will be adding a few more in that tier.
- If you need project ideas, ask ChatGPT using very specific prompts for project ideas of the scope you need and using the skills and technologies you'd like to highlight

## Tier 5 - Dive Deeper

### Goal
The goal of Tier 5 is to enhance your knowledge and abilities by deep diving into areas of particular interest to you. Select one or more focus areas as your interests dictate.

**Select any area that interests you for further study:**

### Tier 5 - Focus Area - React

You will notice that the resources listed here for React are not courses,YouTube playlists, or podcasts where other people teach you React. This section lists the official docs. This is because:
- by this point you should be capable of, and consistently, "reading the docs"
- React changes pretty regularly, tutorials won't be updated, the docs will.
- The docs are actually fantastic and you will learn far more by diving in, as any course or tutorial would only show you bits and pieces, and to be an expert, you need a much bigger picture.

#### Instructions:
- Thoroughly study each resource. Dive deep into the APIs and documentation after working through any tutorials and quickstarts.
- Always be practicing. Ideas for practice:
  - Projects on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges?sort=difficulty%7Casc&type=free) in React
  - Math progression on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math)
  - [Ask ChatGPT to assign you a programming challenge](./RequestingChallengesFromAI.md)
  - Complete four significantly complex practice projects in React. You will want them for your portfolio so make sure they demonstrate the best of your abilities. (Ask ChatGPT for project ideas if you don't have specific projects in mind that you'd like to focus on.)

### Tier 5 - Focus Area - Computer Science

Note: This focus area dives a bit deeper into nitty-gritty computer science topics. Feel free to jump around and take whichever courses sound most interesting to you. (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs is one of my favorites.) You will, at times, find that a course has a mathematics course pre-requisite - those courses may be found in the Mathematics Focus Area above.

## Notes

Before you start, please let me introduce a bit of my philosophy for learning how to be a top-notch programmer. 

- always be learning 
- always be practicing
- always help others when you can 
- include learning some math

Programming, software engineering, web development, whatever you want to call it, however you want to approach it, has one immutable characteristic - it's a field in flux, and there are new advances every day - don't let this discourage you, but do let it instill in you an excitement for **learning**. Learning new technologies should be an exciting opportunity for growth, not a disappointing drudgery. Start, from day one, with a celebratory mindset about learning new things - that mindset will skyrocket your progress.

You’ll learn a lot from taking courses. You’ll learn a lot from watching videos. You’ll learn a lot from “reading the docs.” All of these are important, in fact crucial, on your path. If you want to retain all that great learning, you need to **practice** it. Practice will transform something you've been exposed to into something you can “reliably do.” Lean heavily into practicing.

You're learning, you're practicing - do you want to excel? Yes? Then find opportunities to **help others** learn. There is no other activity that will prepare you better to interview well than consistently helping others. It teaches you to interact well with others and communicate technical concepts.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can find a billion people on the internet who will tell you you don't need **math** to be a good programmer. I agree, to a certain extent. That said, math is about learning to solve increasingly complex problems. And, knowing how to logically go about solving increasingly complex problems is what programming is all about. Don't sleep on math, every little extra bit you learn will make you that much better at problem-solving. Yeah, you “can do fine” without the math, but with it, you fly!

**Helpful (non-programming) resources**
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so) - for taking notes (in markdown which will help you write README's later)
- [Finch](https://finchcare.com/) - take care of yourself while communing with a sweet little birb
Sure! Here's a rewritten and expanded version of your curriculum and general advice, structured for clarity, motivation, and long-term growth:

---

## 🎓 **Curriculum and Learning Strategy Guide**

### 🛠️ **Core Learning Habits**

* **Always keep something active**:
  Maintain **two tracks** at all times:

  1. A **practice project** (something you’re building, tinkering with, or improving), and
  2. A **reading/study resource** (something you're learning from, such as a course, book, or tutorial).
     These give you flexibility—when you're mentally drained from one, you can switch to the other without losing momentum. Together, they reinforce both **application** and **understanding**.

* **Finish what you start**:
  Completing projects and courses—even when they get tough—is essential. It builds:

  * 🧠 **Perseverance** – a crucial skill in all learning.
  * 💪 **Confidence** – by proving to yourself that you can overcome complexity.
  * 🔁 **Focus** – helping you avoid the trap of endlessly circling through beginner material without progressing to mastery.

* **Track your progress (Status/Evidence columns)**:
  If you're using a structured curriculum (like a GitHub repo), update the "Status" to log when you start/finish each item. Use the "Evidence" column to:

  * Link to related projects
  * Include short reflections or notes
  * Record challenges or breakthroughs
    This builds a **self-documenting learning journal** and makes portfolio-building easier later on.

* **Math matters, but don’t stress**:
  Each tier includes links to Khan Academy math courses. Don’t obsess over "which math you need"; just aim to:

  * Learn slightly more than you know now.
  * Level up over time: Start wherever you are and work toward **algebra → geometry → trigonometry → statistics → precalc → calculus → discrete math**.
    Math will help you think more rigorously. Small, steady practice pays off long-term.

---

## 🌱 **General Growth Principles**

### 🧠 **Mindset & Motivation**

* **When motivation is low, commit to 5 minutes**:
  If you’re feeling stuck or tired, say: “Just five minutes.” Do it. Even if that’s all you manage, it’s progress. Often, you’ll do more. If not, be okay with that. Five minutes is still better than zero.

* **Sleep is a learning tool**:
  Never underestimate rest. Memory consolidation and pattern recognition happen while you're sleeping. If you're feeling foggy, don’t push through—**go rest**. You'll often come back with clarity.

* **Eat well to think clearly**:
  A well-nourished brain is more resilient, more focused, and more creative. Prioritize whole foods, hydration, and consistent meals. Your ability to learn is directly tied to your body's fuel.

* **Move your body to sharpen your mind**:
  Daily physical activity—even walking—reduces stress, improves memory, and sharpens focus. You don’t need to train like an athlete; just be consistently active.

### 🤝 **Social Learning & Contribution**

* **Teach what you know, even early**:
  As soon as you understand something—even a little—find someone who’s one step behind and help them. You’ll:

  * Solidify your own understanding.
  * Practice **communicating technical ideas**—a crucial lifelong skill.
  * Build confidence and empathy.

  Join communities like The Odin Project’s Discord, FreeCodeCamp’s forums, or Reddit subs like r/learnprogramming. Ask questions. Answer others'. It multiplies your growth.

* **Document your journey**:
  Use **Markdown files** and version them in a **GitHub or GitLab repository**. This gets you comfortable with:

  * `git` and version control,
  * writing technical documentation, and
  * building a personal knowledge base.
    You’ll create a timeline of your progress, and future you will thank you.

### 🌍 **Ethics & Attitude**

* **Stay grounded**:
  The more you learn, the more you’ll realize how much you *don’t* know. Stay humble. Encourage others. Be generous with your knowledge, and curious about theirs. Never gatekeep—open doors for others.

* **Kindness > Competence (but aim for both)**:
  You’ll go further by being someone who others enjoy working with. Skills matter. So does how you treat people. Respect, empathy, and curiosity will carry you through the hardest parts of any project.

---

## 🔁 **Final Thought: Growth Is Iterative**

Learning is not a linear path. You'll loop back, hit walls, change directions—and that's okay. Build a routine that’s:

* Sustainable
* Reflective
* Community-connected
* Fueled by curiosity, not fear

Start where you are. Stick with it. Track your journey. Share your wins. Build things. Rest when needed. And help others rise with you.

You're not just learning to code (or design, or build)—you’re learning to **learn**, and that’s the real superpower.
