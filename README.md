# Computer Science and Programming - Version 4.0

Fork of p1xt-guides curriculum for tracking my individual progress. I will be modifying this somewhat, substituting some courses for similar material that I have already started working on or have previously completed. Courses I am substituting will be crossed out, with the replacement course to the right. I will not be following this completely in order. For the work I'm currently doing, some skills are more valuable for me to learn sooner rather than later.

**I'm currently working on the 'Junior Developer' tiers**

## Junior developer *[In Progress]*

### Tier X - Math Prep

Math will be relevant throughout the guide. Begin it as you start the guide, and incrementally work through it alongside the guide. (You need not finish this before moving to tier 0, or tier 1, but be actively working on it alongside them.)

### Tier X - Programming Prep Prep

A very gentle introduction, complete if feel you would benefit from it, skip if you'd rather dive right into tier 0

| Complete a [Specialization](#specializations) - note: you may elect to complete another round of a specialization you selected in a prior tier, or branch out and complete a different specialization |            |

### Tier 5 - Specialize

Wrap up by diving more deeply into your specialization(s). If you haven't already done an [Advanced Specialization](#advanced-specializations), strongly consider including it in this tier. Beyond that, feel free to laser focus on one specialization, practicing more in that area, or branch out and develop expertise across multiple specializations.
