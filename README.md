# Computer Science and Programming - Version 4.0

Please read the [FAQ](./faq.md) and note that there are [Tier Project Ideas](./project_ideas.md) to help you select projects.

**Note:** Prior guides have been deprecated but are still available [here](./deprecated/README.md)

## Table of Contents

### Junior developer

If you want to develop the skills necessary to be 'job ready' for a junior developer position - complete tier X, 0, and 1.

- [tier X - Math Prep](#tier-x---math-prep)
- [tier X - Programming Prep Prep](#tier-x---programming-prep-prep)
- [tier 0 - Programming Prep](#tier-0---web-development---fullstack-bootcamp---app-academy-open)
- [tier 1 - Getting Started](#tier-1---getting-started)

### Intermediate developer

If you want to develop the skills necessary to move beyond junior to intermediate developer - once you've finished tiers X, 0 and 1, proceed to complete tiers 2 and 3.

- [tier 2 - Develop More Expertise](#tier-2---develop-more-expertise)
- [tier 3 - Add More Rigor](#tier-3---add-more-rigor)

### Advanced developer

If you want to develop the skills necessary to move beyond intermediate to advanced developer - once you've finished tiers X, 0, 1, 2, and 3, proceed to complete tiers 4 and 5.

- [tier 4 - Polish the Rough Edges](#tier-4---polish-the-rough-edges)
- [tier 5 - Specialize](#tier-5---specialize)

### Specializations

Each tier has a 'specialization' based capstone which involves further study and extensive practice in an area of your choosing. [Web Development - Fullstack Bootcamp - App Academy Open](./specializations/app_academy_open.md) is highly recommended (but not required) as the first specialization. Beyond that, feel free to complete a different specialization each tier, or dive deeply into a specialization by selecting it during multiple tiers to explore it in greater detail and further develop your specialized profile.

- [Web Development - Fullstack Bootcamp - App Academy Open](./specializations/app_academy_open.md) (recommended, but not required, first specialization)
- [Web Development - Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development - Full Stack Open 2020](./specializations/full_stack_open_2020.md)
- [Web Development - Fullstack Bootcamp - The Odin Project](./specializations/the_odin_project.md)
- [Web Development - Frontend](./specializations/frontend.md)
- [Web Development - Backend](./specializations/backend.md)
- [Mobile App Development](./specializations/mobile.md)
- [Game Development](./specializations/games.md)
- [Open Source Contributions](./specializations/open_source.md)

### Advanced Specializations

The following specializations rely on knowledge gained in earlier tiers. Additionally, they are typically 'more difficult' or will require more work than those listed above.

- [Computer Science - Algorithms](./specializations/algorithms.md) -Suggested for Tier 2 or later
- [Computer Science - Advanced Algorithms](./specializations/advanced-algorithms.md) - Computer Science - Algorithms is a pre-requisite
- [Computer Science - Intensive](./specializations/computer_science.md) - Suggested for Tier 4 or later
- [Data Science I](./specializations/data-science-i.md) - Suggested for Tier 2 or later
- [Data Science II](./specializations/data-science-ii.md) - Data Science I is a pre-requisite

### Tier Programming Projects

Both tiers and specializations will require 'Tier Programming Projects', you are free to select any programming project you want. To help combat the 'but I don't know what I want' roadblock, [Tier Programming Project Ideas](./project_ideas.md) lists a variety of ideas.

**Note:** In specializations, the Tier Programming Projects might have extra criteria (such as 'if you're doing a mobile app development specialization your projects must be mobile apps')

## Junior developer

### Tier X - Math Prep

Math will be relevant throughout the guide. Begin it as you start the guide, and incrementally work through it alongside the guide. (You need not finish this before moving to tier 0, or tier 1, but be actively working on it alongside them.)

### Tier 5 - Specialize

Wrap up by diving more deeply into your specialization(s). If you haven't already done an [Advanced Specialization](#advanced-specializations), strongly consider including it in this tier. Beyond that, feel free to laser focus on one specialization, practicing more in that area, or branch out and develop expertise across multiple specializations.
