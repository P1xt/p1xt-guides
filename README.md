## Summary
Resources for learners who want to dive deeper on their journey to becoming web developers / software engineers. 
There are multiple guides, the first outlines the bare minimum to be successful as an 
entry-level junior web developer, two dive much more deeply to prepare you for "beyond junior", 
and one that focuses on game development.

**Additional guides added:**
- Android Development - May, 2017
- Data Science - September, 2017
- Job Ready Python - September, 2017
- Job Ready JavaScript 2.0 - September, 2017

A few people suggested making it possible to buy me a coffee as thanks - so please feel free but not obligated to

Do not click that button if you don't want to or can't afford to. I devote time to this project because I want to, in my free time, because I value helping others. Not for donations. The button is just there on a lark because a couple people asked for it and I'm, frankly, curious. Donations (or lack thereof) will not alter my dedication to this project either way.

## Attribution

* Many of the courses listed closely mimic the list from [Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)
* Many of the topics selected to augment were inspired by [Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university)
* Many of the projects were inspired by (or are directly taken from) [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/), [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)

Although I took heavy inspiration from many resources when creating these guides, none of it is a cut and paste path from somewhere else. Often, I substituted courses (especially in the case of Coursera) to ensure that the entire course was available for free and required no purchases of any kind. Where possible, I tried to align projects to reinforce prior learning.
