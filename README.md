## Summary
Resources for learners who want to dive deeper on their journey to becoming web developers / software engineers. 
There are multiple guides, the first outlines the bare minimum to be successful as an 
entry-level junior web developer, two dive much more deeply to prepare you for "beyond junior", 
and one that focuses on game development.

Additional guides added:

Android Development - May, 2017

A few people suggested making it possible to buy me a coffee as thanks - so please feel free but not obligated to

Do not click that button if you don't want to or can't afford to. I devote time to this project because I want to, in my free time, because I value helping others. Not for donations. The button is just there on a lark because a couple people asked for it and I'm, frankly, curious. Donations (or lack thereof) will not alter my dedication to this project either way.


## Guides

### Get Job ready with 13 projects, 2 courses, and 10 books 

A structured plan of resources and activities for learners who want to beeline to "job ready" and get there 
reasonably prepared to be successful.

**Goal:** confident web developer ready to apply for junior positions

### Computer Science and Web Development - comprehensive

Get prepared, over the long haul, to be an established senior level software engineer, capable of 
architecting solutions for the web (and beyond it) 

_"not in a rush" plan, with resources to increase the depth of knowledge gained in general computer science topics plus
sufficient implementation practice to confidently enter the industry as a Web Developer or a Software Engineer in 
non Web related positions_

**Goal:** proficient web developer and software engineer 
(this option has more of a computer science focus, but also web development)

[go to the Computer Science and Web Development Guide](./cs-wd.md)


### Web Development with Computer Science Foundations - comprehensive

Get prepared, over the long haul, to be an established senior level web developer, at the level where 
companies would be lucky to have you and people would be following your blog because you're an expert 

_"not in a rush" plan that focuses on pushing beyond beginner level, and intermediate level, to expert 
level as a web developer with a reasonable foundation in software engineering_ 

**Goal:** confident web developer ready to apply for non-junior positions
(this one primarily focuses on web development but includes enough computer science to lay a good foundation)

## Attribution

* Many of the courses listed closely mimic the list from [Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)
* Many of the topics selected to augment were inspired by [Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university)
* Many of the projects were inspired by (or are directly taken from) [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/), [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)

Although I took heavy inspiration from many resources when creating these guides, none of it is a cut and paste path from somewhere else. Often, I substituted courses (especially in the case of Coursera) to ensure that the entire course was available for free and required no purchases of any kind. Where possible, I tried to align projects to reinforce prior learning.
