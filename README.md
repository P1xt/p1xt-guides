# Computer Science and Programming - Version 4.0

Fork of p1xt-guides curriculum for tracking my individual progress. I will be modifying this guide somewhat, substituting some courses for similar material that I have already started working on or have previously completed. I will not be following this completely in order; courses that are relevant to my current role or personal projects may be prioritized.

Some helpful information has been removed and can be viewed as needed in the [official p1xt-guides repo](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides).

### Tier X - Math Prep

Math will be relevant throughout the guide. Begin it as you start the guide, and incrementally work through it alongside the guide. (You need not finish this before moving to tier 0, or tier 1, but be actively working on it alongside them.)

### Tier X - Programming Prep Prep

I've previously completed material that I think adequately meets or exceeds the materials recommend, so I am substituting this entire section with my previously completed courses.

### Tier 0 - Web Development - Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development - Full Stack Open 2022

Per the [FAQ](./faq.md#do-i-really-have-to-do-app-academy-open-in-tier-0-why-should-i-waste-time-on-ruby), I am substituting [App Academy Open](https://open.appacademy.io/) with [Web Development - Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development - Full Stack Open 2022](./specializations/full_stack_open_2020.md). This substitution is better aligned with my current role.

### Tier 5 - Specialize

Wrap up by diving more deeply into your specialization(s). If you haven't already done an [Advanced Specialization](#advanced-specializations), strongly consider including it in this tier. Beyond that, feel free to laser focus on one specialization, practicing more in that area, or branch out and develop expertise across multiple specializations.
