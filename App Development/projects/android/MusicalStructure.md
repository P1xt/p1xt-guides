# Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making the structure of a music app using intents and empty activities.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Music app which would allow a user to play audio files. There are many music player apps, and they make a wide variety of design choices. It will be your job to decide what kind of music app your structure would turn into and build out that structure using intents. Will you build an app to play music from the user’s library of music? Will you build an app to stream random songs from a database? Will you build a musical suggestion engine? Those choices are up to you! 

If you are subscribed to the paid Nanodegree program, coaches will be available in the Coaches Lounge to help guide you through the final project. You will receive feedback after submitting your project and a verified certificate after successfully finishing this project.

If you are enrolled in the free version of this course, the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/159/view) and all of the project details are available to you.

Either way, we would love to see a description and link to your app on the discussion forum.
# Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned how to think about the structure of an app and how to use OnClickListeners and explicit Intents to link between different activities within your own app. Practicing these skills will drastically improve the quality of the apps you build down the road. 


# What Will I Learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:
* Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
* Creating new activities
* Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app. 
* Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
