## Project Overview

This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game. 

The goal is to create an **Score Keeper app** which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice.  To build this project, you can follow along with the practice set and customize the Court Counter app to track scores from a different sport.

### Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned how to make use of Java in your Android apps to make them interactive. With Score Keeper, you will be practicing this skill set, with particular focus on button code, variable scope, and updating views.

### Subscription vs Free-Version student

If you are subscribed to the paid Nanodegree program, coaches will be available in the Coaches Lounge to help guide you through the final project. You will receive feedback after submitting your project and a verified certificate after successfully finishing this project.

If you are enrolled in the free version of this course, the project rubric and all of the project details are available to you.

Either way, we would love to see a description and link to your app on the discussion forum.
