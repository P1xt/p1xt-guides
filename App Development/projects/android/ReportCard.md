# Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be creating a single file this time - a custom class to represent a report card. 

The goal is to design and create the structure of a ReportCard Class which would allow a school to store a student’s grades for a particular year. This project will be just a java class, rather than a full Android app.

If you are subscribed to the paid Nanodegree program, coaches will be available in the Coaches Lounge to help guide you through the final project. You will receive feedback after submitting your project and a verified certificate after successfully finishing this project.

If you are enrolled in the free version of this course, the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/160/view) and all of the project details are available to you.

Either way, we would love to see a description and link to your app on the discussion forum.
# Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned about  custom classes, which are critical to every object-oriented program you will build going forward. It is vital to be able to think about how to design objects which interact with each other and model real-world concepts.
 
# What Will I Learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:
* Designing a custom class
* Creating that class in Java code.
* Storing information in an array
* Looping through an array
