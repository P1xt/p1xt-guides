## Project Overview
In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app.

## Why this Project?
This project gives you an opportunity to improve an app’s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

##What Will I Learn?

Through this project, you will:

* Understand the fundamentals of Android design.
* Apply Material Design guidelines to an mobile application.
* Separate an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively use transitions and motion.

## How Will I Complete this Project?

You will improve an app for this project:

* <b>XYZ Reader</b>: A mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and shocking headlines! <a href="https://www.udacity.com/api/nodes/4292653440/supplemental_media/xyzreaderzip/download" target="_blank">Download the code here</a>.

The app is currently functional, and work in most cases for most users. 

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

### Supporting Courses
You should have the skills you need to complete this app after completing: 

* <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud853-nd" target="_blank">Developing Android Apps</a>
* <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud855-nd" target="_blank">Advanced Android App Development</a>
* <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud862-nd" target="_blank">Material Design for Android Developers</a>

You can also refer to the [Material Design specification](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html).

### Required Tasks

* Download a zip file of the app.
* Read the UI Review in the next node.
* Spend time exploring the current state of the app, looking for ways it could be improved. The app will need multiple improvements. Be sure to look specifically at issues called out in the UI Review. 
* Execute the improvements! 
* Make a single GitHub repo with your code for the app and submit it through the Nanodegree portal. See the Submission and Evaluation node for detailed instructions. 

For detailed information on how your project will be assessed, see the Rubric node.

## User Feedback for XYZ Reader:

### Lyla says:
“This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

### Jay says: 
“Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

### Kagure says: 
“The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”

## Project Rubric

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to <a href="https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/4035898751/rubric" target="_blank">this rubric</a>. 

Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass. 

Continue to the next node for submission and evaluation instructions.

## Submission and Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to the rubric in the previous node. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

**Note**:  Please make sure you **clean** your project before creating a zip file or pushing code to a GitHub repository. You can clean your project by following the instructions given in **[this](https://goo.gl/8lgeV5)** link.

If you are using GitHub to host your projects, please make sure the code you want to submit for review is in the **master** branch of your repository.

**IMPORTANT: If you're submitting via a public Github repository, please make sure any external API key that you utilize, has been removed from your code.**  It's highly unsafe (and often breaks the Terms of Service) to include API keys in public repos, so you need to remove yours. You can add a note in a README file where a reviewer should go to insert their API key. Reviewers have been trained to expect this situation.

When you're ready to submit your project, click on Udacity in the navigation bar at the top your screen to return to your Udacity Home. Then, locate and expand the project you'd like to submit. Click on the button to submit your project. You can view the submission process in more detail <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sfMGTlUxxkcZM6iRXbVZ45vPPZGRD4qEp3ENBGSmZ_o/pub?embedded=true" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you have any problems submitting your project, please email us at **android-project@udacity.com**. Due to the high volume of submissions, the turnaround for your project can take **up to a week**.

Each Android ND project will be reviewed against the<a href="http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html" target="_blank"> Common Project Requirements</a>, in addition to its project-specific rubric.
