## Project Overview
In this project, you will build a wearable watch face for Sunshine to run on an Android Wear device.

## Why this Project?
Android Wear is an exciting way to integrate your app more directly into usersâ€™ lives. As a new developer, it will be important for you to understand how to perform this integration. This project gives you an opportunity to design a companion app for Sunshine, tying it to a watch face in order to enrich the experience.

## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:

* Understand the fundamentals of Android Wear.
* Design for multiple watch form factors.
* Communicate between a mobile device and a wearable device.

## How Will I Complete this Project?

But certainly feel free to customize and create per your own taste and preferences! We're looking forward to seeing what you create!

## Project Rubric

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to <a href="https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/4632379138/rubric" target="_blank">this rubric</a>. 

Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass. 

Continue to the next node for submission and evaluation instructions.

## Submission and Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to the rubric in the previous node. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must "meet specifications" in order to pass.

**Note**:  Please make sure you **clean** your project before creating a zip file or pushing code to a GitHub repository. You can clean your project by following the instructions given in **[this](https://goo.gl/8lgeV5)** link.

If you are using GitHub to host your projects, please make sure the code you want to submit for review is in the **master** branch of your repository.

**IMPORTANT: If you're submitting via a public Github repository, please make sure any external API key that you utilize, has been removed from your code.**  It's highly unsafe (and often breaks the Terms of Service) to include API keys in public repos, so you need to remove yours. You can add a note in a README file where a reviewer should go to insert their API key. Reviewers have been trained to expect this situation.

When you're ready to submit your project, click on Udacity in the navigation bar at the top your screen to return to your Udacity Home. Then, locate and expand the project you'd like to submit. Click on the button to submit your project. You can view the submission process in more detail <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sfMGTlUxxkcZM6iRXbVZ45vPPZGRD4qEp3ENBGSmZ_o/pub?embedded=true" target="_blank">here</a>.

If you have any problems submitting your project, please email us at **android-project@udacity.com**. Due to the high volume of submissions, the turnaround for your project can take **up to a week**.

Each Android ND project will be reviewed against the<a href="http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html" target="_blank"> Common Project Requirements</a>, in addition to its project-specific rubric.
