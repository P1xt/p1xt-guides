# Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making a habit tracking app using an SQLite table. 

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time.

If you are subscribed to the paid Nanodegree program, coaches will be available in the Coaches Lounge to help guide you through the final project. You will receive feedback after submitting your project and a verified certificate after successfully finishing this project.

If you are enrolled in the free version of this course, the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/162/view) and all of the project details are available to you.

Either way, we would love to see a description and link to your app on the discussion forum.
# Why this project?
In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned about data storage in a SQLite database on Android. This is critical if you want to make any app that persists a user’s data over time or syncs with an online database for offline use.
 
# What Will I Learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:
* Creating a SQLite table in your app
* Populating that table with new entries
* Modifying the entries
* Displaying the contents of the table to users.
