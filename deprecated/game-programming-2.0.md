# Video Game Programming - comprehensive foundations 

I list a lot of games to clone in this list. I do not mean make the exact same game down to the assets and name and everything. I mean make a game that uses the same mechanics. **Don't get yourself sued for copyright violation.**
There are references at the bottom of this list to answer some common questions relevant only to this guide (and thus not present in the [FAQ](./faq.md) which contains a plathora of information pertinent to not only this guide, but the others as well.)

## Tier 5

Tier 5 involves branching out to target the platforms you're most interested in and developing skills in the relevant technologies. At this point, you have a strong foundation in maths and algorithms, significant practice working with graphics, hands on experience building a variety of games, exposure to AI and Machine learning, exposure to networking and hardware concerns, and should have learned various software engineering practices (design, testing, debugging) so that you're writing quality code.

Now that you've got a really strong foundation, the sky's the limit. Pick the platform you want to develop for, Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, Mac, Web, XBox, Playstation, whatever - and start reading. Start with official docs, read them all. Find blogs dedicated to that platform. Rebuild some of the easiest projects you've done thus far, targeting that platform.

Use the Force :D

* [Wirify](https://www.wirify.com/) - for quickly turning a web page into a wireframe so you can see the big picture instead of all the graphics


## For every game project

* Mockup the game screens by hand, using Pencil, or in graphics software - before you start coding the game
* Write a document describing the game, win conditions, lose conditions, and features you intend to include - before you start coding
* Create a minimal demo before building out the whole things
* Store your mockups, design documentation, and game progress in a versionable repository (GitHub)
* Include tests :D
* Include documentation on how to build and run the game
