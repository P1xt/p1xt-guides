# Computer Science and Backend Development - Java Focus

If you have any questions, be sure to check the [FAQ](./faq.md). In fact, before you even start anything, go read the FAQ.
It has a plethora of hints, tips and answers to help you ensure you get the most out of this guide.

>Note that at the end of each tier, there are a number of "choose your own" projects. Do not feel you have to wait until the end of the tier to complete them - whenever you want to "build", just skip to the end of the tier, build something, check it off, then return to where you were.

**Project suggestions:** Above all, pick something you're interested in building. It doesn't have to be a "web page", it could be a command line utility, a mobile app, some fancy arduino robot, or yes, a web page, or anything else you are inspired to build. Try to pick something substantial for the level you're at - 40+ hours of effort. Try not to pick something so daunting it'll take you months or (worse) you won't be able to complete.

**Specific Project Ideas**
* Clone a popular website, with either emphasis on some fancy frontend, or the emphasis on a rock solid API with the minimal frontend necessary to test it
* Clone pretty much any template you find on the web, but do it in Kotlin as an Android app
* Build/clone a game
* Hit Kaggle and build a kernel for solving one of the problems there
* Hit HackerRank or CodinGame for a weeklong problem solving binge, finishing as many problems as you possibly can
* Build a command line utility that automates something you do frequently.
* Contribute a PR to the Open Source project of your choice
* Write a series of blog posts / tutorials that explain thoroughly some topic you've been studying
* Build an application you wish was available, but isn't
