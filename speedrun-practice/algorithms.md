# Algorithms and Data Structures - Speedrun / Practice

## Notes
The following is a list of practice problems for studying algorithms and data structures.

Recommendation: select one programming language and complete all of the problems using that language. If you want to add an additional language, complete them all in the language you selected first, then repeat them with your second language choice. Good choices for a first language are C++ (runs fast) and Python (fast to code), though any language will work (yes, including JavaScript).
