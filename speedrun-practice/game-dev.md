# Game Development - Speedrun / Practice

## Notes
The following is a list of practice projects for game development intended to be used as ideas for portfolio projects or for use in a speedrun (set aside a month or two and speed through as many as you can in that time - as an intensive hands on practice.)

Always find or make your own open source assets when doing any clone, and attribute your sources. Don't get sued for copyright violation.
