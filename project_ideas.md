# Tier Programming Project Ideas

Both tiers and specializations will require 'Tier Programming Projects', you are free to select any programming project you want. To help combat the 'but I don't know what I want' roadblock, this section lists a variety of ideas. Note: In specializations, the Tier Programming Projects might have extra criteria (such as 'if you're doing a mobile app development specialization your projects must be mobile apps')
  
**Note:** Your projects can be any programming project you wish: web development, mobile development, games, applications, command line utilities, browser extensions, compilers, _anything_. They can be small to large endeavors. Pick something you want to code, that will provide you practice with existing skills or stretch you to grow new skills. Ideas: clone a popular website, clone a website template, create or clone a game, build a command line utility, enter a hackathon/programming competition. Many other ideas are listed below but keep in mind that they are only ideas - you are completely free to either use one of the ideas listed below or an idea of your own.
