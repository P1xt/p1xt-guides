# Angular - Topic Deep Dive

The following is a deep dive, designed to familiarize you thoroughly with Angular. It is not the "easy path to just learning 'enough'" - it aims far higher, combining thorough study of the official docs, regular practice projects, comprehensive exploration of TypeScript, Karma, Jasmine, and Protractor and hands on non-Angular TypeScript practice to ensure a rock solid foundation in everything Angular.

## Tier 0 - reference only if you need pre-Angular basics
- [ ] Course: [Introduction to Computer Science - CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x#!) (If you want more confidence programming)
- [ ]  Articles: How to not f-up your local files with Git [part1](https://medium.com/@francesco.agnoletto/how-to-not-f-up-your-local-files-with-git-part-1-e0756c88fd3c), [part2](https://medium.com/@francesco.agnoletto/how-to-not-f-up-your-local-files-with-git-part-2-fc4e243be02a) and [part 3](https://medium.com/chingu/how-to-not-f-up-your-local-files-with-git-part-3-bf03b27b6e64) (You want to be using git, read these to get up to speed.)
- [ ]  Course: [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) (Intro, to get you started with HTML and CSS)
- [ ]  Course: [Learn to Code Advanced HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/) (Additional HTML and CSS instruction)  
- [ ]  Course: [Getting Sassy with CSS](http://www.sassshop.com/#/) (Dip into Sass, try to hit this before you finish the guide)
- [ ]  Book Series: [YDKJS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/) (You need to KNOW JavaScript, not just sorta-know JavaScript, if you haven't studied these books, do yourself a favor and study them alongside whatever else you might be doing)
- [ ]  Official Docs: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - thoroughly review the User Guide
- [ ]  Official Docs: [Axios npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - thoroughly review, you'll want this for making API calls

## Tier 1 - basics

Study each item thoroughly. Type the code. Understand how it works. Yes, the whole thing. 

**You NEED to know JavaScript** - if you're shaky on JavaScript, do yourself a favor and hit MDN and study, especially ES6 features - and hit YDKJS. 
     
### For each project:
* Use a git workflow (If you wonder what this is, read the articles in Tier 0)

### For at least one project:
* Use Angular Material
* Use Bootstrap

# Tier 4 - beyond intermediate

Study each item thoroughly. Type the code. Understand how it works. Yes, the whole thing.    
### For each project:
* Use a git workflow
* Include at least 20 automated tests
* Utilize Sass
* Implement end-to-end testing

### For at least one project:
* Use Angular Material
* Use Bootstrap

On two projects of your choice - use no CLI or boilerplate created by someone else. Setup the project from scratch using npm init. Setup your own build process. Include only what you need from npm. Know precisely what everything in the setup is doing because you put it there, on purpose, yourself.
